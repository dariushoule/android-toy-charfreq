Android Toy Charfreq
====================

Used in a late 2013 teaching exercise. 

Downloads a webpage and displays an alphabetical character frequency count. Super bite sized chunk of Android code. 

Purposely a bit obtuse to demonstrate concepts larger than the task at hand! 

**Challenges:**

	- Add a progress bar to app to track download progress.
	- Add an URL input box so any webpage a user enters can be downloaded.
	- Sort the resulting characters alphabetically
